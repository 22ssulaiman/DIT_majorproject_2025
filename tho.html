    <p class="one"><P> Is the Norse God of Thunder and the prince of Asgard. His powers are vast, including superhuman strength, the ability to manipulate lightning, and near immortality. He wields the enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, which grants him control over storms and allows him to fly. As a god, Thor has centuries of experience in combat, wisdom, and leadership. Throughout his journey, Thor learns to balance his divine nature with his responsibility as a protector of Earth and his own world, Asgard.</P>
